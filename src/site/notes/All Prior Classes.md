### Thread 1, Day 2 - Wednesday, October 18, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Creating a Notion Account\|Creating a Notion Account]]
2. Tutorial: [[Tutorials/Creating Bookmarks\|Creating Bookmarks]] 
	- Please be sure you make a bookmark for your Notion portfolio page.
3. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/First Post\|First Post]]
4. Install [[Setup/Xcodes\|Xcodes]]
   > [!NOTE]
   > Check your email for an invitation to join the Apple Developer program via Lakefield College School.
   > 
   > **Please create a new Apple ID using your LCS email address to accept the invitation.**
5. Install Xcode 15
	- Use Xcodes to install Xcode 15.
	  > [!TIP]
	  > Do not install Xcode via the App Store, as using this method means that it will automatically get upgraded when a new version is released (which is not always ideal).
6. [Programming with Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-7DQJbMapI)
	- Yesterday, we looked about how Jordi Bruin solved a small problem – visually translating a menu – with the [Cibo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cibo-visual-menu-translator/id1583992402) app.
	- Sometimes, we can help others with major efforts, like writing an app, but...
		- ... how do we get to that place?
		- ... is that the only way to help others?
	- Please have your black hardcover notebook out while you watch *Programming with Purpose* with the class.
		- As you watch, write down any quotes that speak to you.
		- When you are finished watching, summarize a bit – what is *one* takeaway that you have from this video?
		- Please make a post [on Notion](https://notion.so) sharing your takeaway(s) from this video.
## Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Be sure that you have installed Xcodes and Xcode, as described above.
