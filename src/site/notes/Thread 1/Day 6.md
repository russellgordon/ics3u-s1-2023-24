### Thread 1, Day 6 - Wednesday, October 25, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Exercise: Create a Wireframe Layout
	- Select at least five layouts [from these examples](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/wireframes.pdf).
	- Consult SwiftUI Views Mastery as a reference.
	- Recommend that [you use this playground](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/Blueprints.playground.zip) to make your wireframes.
	- Use the same concepts we have just looked at to wireframe the layouts you selected.
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete the exercise on layout as described above, then write about what you learned in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).
